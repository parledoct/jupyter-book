# A first foray into applied speech processing

Parledoct (like 'aqueduct') is a set of tutorials and supporting tools to help bridge the knowledge gap for newcomers interested in applying speech processing techniques to data from language documentation projects in particular.
The materials are aimed at those who have some familiarity with speech data (e.g. annotating in Praat/ELAN) and scripting (e.g. in Praat or R) and want to learn to directly use modern speech processing tools via a command-line interface but are not sure where to start.[^elpis]

<!-- The materials fall into one of two main categories: overviews and recipes. The recipes will be kept relatively brief and contain links to concepts introduced in the various overviews, which themselves provide summarised content with (external) links to more comprehensive materials. -->

To make sure everyone can go through the tutorials without any upfront setup requirements, we will be using [SaturnCloud](https://saturncloud.io/), a platform that lets us launch standardised computation environments that can be used right in the browser. For those who decide that various processing techniques are relevant to their needs, setting up a local computation environment on your own computer is covered in a later tutorial (with a link to a dedicated troubleshooting forum post at the bottom).

Earlier tutorials provide scaffolding for the later ones: for example, the very first tutorial covers launching the browser-accessible computation environment on [SaturnCloud](https://saturncloud.io/), uploading and downloading files to/from the environment, and running basic Python and shell commands within the environment. Later tutorials will assume at least some *familiarity* with content from the earlier ones (though not *mastery*, so there'll be explicit signposting, e.g. 'As we learned before in ...').
