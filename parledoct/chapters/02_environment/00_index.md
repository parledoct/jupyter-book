# Computation environment

When certain food recipes call for specialised tools (a stand mixer, pressure cooker, etc.), not having these tools in your home kitchen (i.e. the environment in which you're carrying out the steps) can make trying out a recipe very much a chore (or sometimes not even possible).

The same thing applies to computation environments: if you don't have a certain set of tools installed on your computer, you probably won't be able to carry out the steps to process your data in a certain way.

To make sure everyone has access to the exact same computation environment, regardless of their computer's operation system (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux) and hardware (e.g. Intel/AMD, Apple Silicon), we'll be using SaturnCloud to launch a standardised environment that you can access right from your browser.
